This is an extremely basic naive bayes implementation using list 
comprehensions.This should never be used for anything. Scikit learn has a 
much faster and more accurate implementation.This was made for fun and for 
learning. If you want to try it out though, it simply needs to be imported 
and trained. If you just want to see how inaccurate it is, you just need to 
run it as follows python naivebayes.py bidal_formatted_txt_file.txt where 
the bidal_formatted_txt_file is just a tab separated file of numeric feature 
vectors whose first field is a class indicator and whose last field is a 
time stamp.
